# TODO

## Common
- Add README.md with a tour.

### Nvim
- Remove `lspconfig-mason`, `mason` and just use `lspconfig` (reading its README) and globally install the linters.
- NIX and JUSTFILE support.
- Why treesitter just died.
- Config cleanup (lua linter and formater, use special {} syntax in functions).
